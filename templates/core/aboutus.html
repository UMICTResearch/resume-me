        <p>
            <strong>What:</strong> Review.me's goal is to build connections among Detroiters to increase employability
            land more jobs!
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>Why:</strong> Job seekers in your area have shown success in obtaining job interviews, though many
            do not land these jobs and don’t understand why. You have expressed a need to connect to people who are able
            to provide honest and constructive interview and resume feedback, and to those willing to share who’s hiring
            in your area.
